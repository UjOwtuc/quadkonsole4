QuadKonsole embeds Konsole kparts in a grid layout. The number of rows and
columns of Konsoles is 2 by 2 by default, but can be specified on the
command-line. The settings of the Konsoles can be accessed using the right mouse
button and can be saved. These settings apply to the system globally, to all
Konsole kparts. Konsole widgets get focus as soon as the mouse hovers on them
(focus follows mouse). This can be disabled on the command-line. What else...
mmm... Try removing the window border or going full screen using the window menu
(Alt-F3) for even more screen real-estate.

Use CTRL + SHIFT + arrow key to move from konsole to konsole.

Type "quadkonsole --help" for info about switches. There are some interesting
ones...
